## Title
Number plate recognition using images captured from drones

## Problem Statement:
Developing an ML project that detects the number plate of a vehicle and stores it to the database.

## Introduction:
We, as a team of beginners, had no prior knowledge of how to achieve this task. We aimed to take out frames from the video and manipulate them. We were able to detect the number plate from the vehicle using edge detection. However, the main hurdle was deciding which frame to pick from the video that clearly shows the license plate.

## Our Proposed Approach:
We utilized edge detection techniques to identify the number plate from the frames. We attempted to create an algorithm that would select the frames with the most suitable angle for the number plate to be detected.

## Why Choose Our Solution?
Our solution utilizes edge detection techniques to identify the number plate from the frames, which is a reliable and accurate approach. In addition, our algorithm helps select the frames with the most suitable angle for the number plate to be detected, thus enhancing the accuracy of our solution.

## Limitations of Our Solution:
Our solution might face difficulties in identifying number plates in low-light conditions, blurry images, or images with partially obstructed number plates. Our solution assumes that the license plates are placed in a standard position on the vehicle and might not be effective for vehicles with non-standard number plate positioning.
